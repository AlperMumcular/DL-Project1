## Project Overview

This is the first project for the Deep Learning course at NYU. The goal of this project was to develop a ResNet model and achieve the highest possible accuracy on the given task under 5M parameter constraint.

### Best Scoring Model:
- Our best scoring model has an accuracy of **0.87709**.
- The model can be found in the folder `0.87709 - Best Model` with the notebook file located at:  
  `0.87709 - Best Model/0_87709.ipynb`.

---

## Report:
- A detailed report for the project can be accessed in the file:  
  `project_report.pdf`.

## Setup & Execution:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload the notebook `0_87709.ipynb` to Google Colab to view and run the best model.
3. Upload `cifar_test_nolabel.pkl` to Google Colab. You may run the whole code. (Note: T4 GPU cannot finish in free trial limit. We used A100 GPU to train our models)
4. If you just want to load `best_model.pth`, upload it as well and run the code after training code.
